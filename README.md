# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game project! This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The game features a snake that grows longer as it eats food, with the objective of achieving the highest score possible without colliding with the snake's own body.

## Overview
This project contains a simple yet engaging implementation of the Snake game. The snake moves around a grid, eats food to grow, and the game ends if the snake collides with itself. The player can restart the game after a game over.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/officialprakashkumarsingh/ppo.git
   cd ppo
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required Pygame library:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. **Run the Game**:
   Execute the main game script:
   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ```

## How to Play
- Use the **arrow keys** (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
- Guide the snake to eat the red food blocks to grow longer and increase your score.
- Avoid colliding with the snake's own body, as this will end the game.
- When the game is over, press **R** to restart.

## Features
- Simple and intuitive controls using arrow keys.
- Score tracking based on the number of food items eaten.
- Game over detection with a restart option.
- Wrap-around mechanics (snake reappears on the opposite side when it hits the edge).

## Dependencies
- **Python 3.x**: The programming language used for this project.
- **Pygame**: A library for creating 2D video games in Python. Install it via `pip install pygame`.
